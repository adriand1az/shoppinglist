# Shoppinglist

This project adds items to a list and writes it to a file.

## Usage

This program can be used if there are a list of items that the user would like to store.<br>


## Why

This project was created because I wanted to solidify what I learned about list and object oriented programming.<br>
I attempted to make the code as easy to read and efficient as possible.
